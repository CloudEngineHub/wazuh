  # 1.1.1.8 Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited (Not Scored)
  - id: 33006
    title: "Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited."
    description: "The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are supported by the vfat kernel module."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: "The FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition. Disabling the vfat module can prevent boot on UEFI systems. FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media which are commonly used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may prevent the ability to transfer files in this way."
    remediation: "Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf Example: vim etc/modprobe.d/vfat.conf install vfat /bin/true Run the following command to unload the vfat module: # rmmod vfat."

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Automated)
  - id: 33007
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid."

In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp . For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Impact: Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."

     description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."

You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.

Notes: Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and documented before such an exception is made."

In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd. This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system."

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

     title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
     description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
     rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent."

Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."

     title: "Ensure access to the su command is restricted."
     description: "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo , which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su , the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su ."
     rationale: "Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."

     title: "Audit system file permissions."
     description: "The RPM and Debian package managers have a number of useful options. One of these, the --verify (or -V for RPM) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option: Code Meaning S File size differs. M File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5 The MD5 checksum differs. D The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file. L A mismatch occurs in a link. U The file ownership differs. G The file group owner differs. T The file time (mtime) differs. The rpm -qf or dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to: # rpm -qf /bin/bash bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64 # dpkg -S /bin/bash bash: /bin/bash To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: # rpm -V bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64 .M....... /bin/bash # dpkg --verify bash ??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: # rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` .M...... c /etc/passwd S.5....T c /etc/printcap."
     rationale: "It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor."

  # 6.1.14 Audit SGID executables. (Not Scored)

     title: "Audit SGID executables."
     description: "The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the group. The most common reason for a SGID program is to enable users to perform functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges."
     rationale: "There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced."
     remediation: "Ensure that no rogue SGID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries."
